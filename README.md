## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v22` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v11`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd fcp-dal-upstream-mock
nvm use
```

## Local development

### Setup

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

> NOTE: Contract testing is described separately [here](./test/contract/README.md).

### Production

### Update dependencies

To update dependencies use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates):

> The following script is a good start. Check out all the options on
> the [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

## API endpoints
